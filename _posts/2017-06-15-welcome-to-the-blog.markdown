Welcome to this blog, which is the new home for thoughts and technical things. As `babelgraph.org` has been retired, you can still get the code at:

Over time I will try to migrate the old blog posts (mostly dealing with network analyses and C++ using R) to here along with the very informative user comments, and updates.

For old time's sake, here is the old thumbnail gallery from the BabelGraph Alpha release (mixed Linux and Mac screenshots). A beautiful sight!
