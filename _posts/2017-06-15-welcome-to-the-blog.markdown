Welcome to this blog, which is the new home for thoughts and technical things. As `babelgraph.org` has been retired, you can still get the code at:

[BabelGraph Alpha](https://github.com/gweissman/BabelGraph)

Over time I will try to migrate the old blog posts (mostly dealing with network analyses and C++ using R) to here along with the very informative user comments, and updates.
