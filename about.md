    <td >Welcome to my research page! I am a pulmonary and critical care medicine physician. I take care of patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, and I study critical care health services and policy within the <a href=''>Palliative and Advanced Illness Research Center</a> and the <a hre="http://ldi.upenn.edu">Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics</a>. My topical interests are in the longitudinal pathways of patients with critical illness, population health, and low-resource critical care delivery. My methodologic interests include machine learning, natural language processing, and social network analysis.</td>
