    <td >Welcome to my research page! I am a pulmonary and critical care medicine physician. I take care of patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, and I work on critical care health services research and policy within the <a href='http://pair.upenn.edu'>Palliative and Advanced Illness Research Center</a>, the <a href="http://ldi.upenn.edu">Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics</a>, and the <a href='http://chibe.upenn.edu'>Center for Health Incentives and Behavioral Economics</a>. My topical interests are in the longitudinal pathways of patients with critical illness, population health, and low-resource critical care delivery. My methodologic interests include machine learning, natural language processing, and social network analysis.</td>
