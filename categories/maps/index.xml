      <description>Every now and then it is useful to make a map. In times of political uncertainty, data can light a path forward. Your local elected officals may be interested in data, too, and how they impact policy (and re-election, of course).

Please note that Google Maps terms of service are relevant for large data requests and potential privacy concerns for protected health information.
