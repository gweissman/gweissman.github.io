      <title>Comparison of bootstrapping approaches for identifying variance of predictive performance</title>

      <description>Background Bootstrapping is a helpful technique for identifying the variance of an estimate in a given sample when no other data are available. In the case of the evaluation of clinical prediction models, bootstrapping can be used to estimate confidence intervals around performance metrics such as the Brier score, the c-statistic, and others. When the original model and its tuning parameters, and the original dataset are available, the data can be resampled and the model refit on each replicate to make predictions.</description>

      <title>Making choropleth maps by zip code</title>

      <description>Every now and then it is useful to make a map. In times of political uncertainty, data can light a path forward. Your local elected officals may be interested in data, too, and how they impact policy (and re-election, of course).
Let&amp;rsquo;s say you wanted to know if people are still enrolling the Healthcare.gov plans in your local State Senatorial district. It&amp;rsquo;s quite difficult to find data broken up at this level but zip codes can approximate such an approach.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s the blog post originally posted on babelgraph.org on April 4, 2011. I suspect the twitter API and much of the code below are not up to date.
I am a recent comer to twitter, and it took me a few weeks to figure out what this was all about. Who are all these people tweeting each other and what do all these trending hashtags mean? Do these people all know each other?</description>

      <description>Not infrequently I am in a research meeting and someone says, &amp;ldquo;It would be really cool to get data on travel times for people. But I don&amp;rsquo;t know where to find that.&amp;rdquo; Here you will find just that. Please note that Google Maps terms of service are relevant for large data requests and potential privacy concerns for protected health information.

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s the blog post originally posted on babelgraph.org on April 14, 2012.
In a recent blog post by CMastication, a little meme puzzle is presented with the introduction that a preschooler could solve it in 5-10 minutes, a programmer in an hour. I took the bait.
The original problem goes like this:
8809=6 7111=0 2172=0 6666=4 1111=0 3213=0 7662=2 9313=1 0000=4 2222=0 3333=0 5555=0 8193=3 8096=5 7777=0 9999=4 7756=1 6855=3 9881=5 5531=0 2581=?</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s the blog post originally posted on babelgraph.org on July 11, 2012. Thanks to Hadley Wickham for referencing some of content here, and apologies for the broken URL. NB. The original C++ code didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to compile on my computer today. It required a small tweak with NumericVector::create &amp;ndash; see below.
In particular, R data frames provide a simple framework for representing large cohorts of agents in stochastic epidemiological models, such as those representing disease transmission.</description>
