      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s the blog post originally posted on babelgraph.org on July 11, 2012.

It required a small tweak with NumericVector::create &amp;ndash; see below.
In particular, R data frames provide a simple framework for representing large cohorts of agents in stochastic epidemiological models, such as those representing disease transmission.</description>
