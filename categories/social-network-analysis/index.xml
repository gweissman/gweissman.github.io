      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s the blog post originally posted on babelgraph.org on March 25, 2011.

The edgelist, despite many more intervening seasons, and thus many more romances, has not been updated. Here is a nice walkthrough of ERGMs based on this post &amp;ndash; sorry for the broken link, Ben.
This all began with an introductory presentation about social network analysis to a group of medical students.</description>
