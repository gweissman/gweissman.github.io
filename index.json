Sometimes traditional performance measures such as the Brier score or C-statistic might be used to quantify to what extent one model performs better than another. But in the realm of clinical medicine, a model’s predictive performance, whether measured by discrimination, calibration, or something else, doesn’t guarantee clinical benefit. When it comes to patients, that is usually the most important thing.\nThe clinical benefit of a prediction model, however, is not straightforward to measure. How well does the model perform for an individual patient? How might delivery of the predictive information to different stakeholders influence (or not) their decision making? Does the model perform better for some groups of patients compared to others? How do individual stakeholders value different aspects of the prediction model, including different errors? How are the costs and benefits accounted for?\nIf one wanted to answer these questions, undertaking a discrete choice experiment, an ethnographic study with qualitative interviews of all stakeholders, a human factors development and design process, and a randomized clinical trial, could help. But these studies are complex, time consuming, and costly. Is there a faster way to compare the clinical benefit of a group of prediction models?\n Decision curve analysis and net benefit In 2006, Vickers and Elkin introduced the idea of Decision Curve Analysis, an approach to estimate the net benefit of a prediction model using only the data available from the model itself. That is, using only the predicted probabilities of a model along with the observed outcomes, and relying on the assumption that a decision threshold is chosen to represent the relative importance of sensitivity and specificity (or false positive and false negative predictions), the authors describe how to calculate the net benefit of a model.\nIn plain language, the net benefit is the proportion of people rightly treated less the proportion wrongly treated, weighted by the decision threshold to choose treatment or not.\nFor a helpful discussion on interpreting decision curves see Vickers, van Calster, and Steyerberg (2019).\nIn the original paper, the net benefit is calculated as:\n\\[ \\frac{TP_c}{N} - \\frac{FP_c}{N} \\left(\\frac{p_t}{1 - p_t}\\right) \\]\nwhere \\(TP_c\\) and \\(FP_c\\) are the true- and false-positive counts, respectively, \\(N\\) is the number of observations, and \\(p_t\\) is the probability threshold.\n An implementation in R Here is an implementation of the net benefit calculation that is implemented in the gmish package:\nnb \u0026lt;- function(preds, obs, p_t, weight = 1) { weight * tpc(preds, obs, thresh = p_t) / length(preds) - fpc(preds, obs, thresh = p_t) / length(preds) * p_t / (1 - p_t) } The tpc and fpc functions provide the true- and false-positive counts at the threshold p_t. This function also allows further weighting but we’ll save that for a later discussion. The default weight = 1 reduces to the original equation described above. To calculate the net benefit over the full range of thresholds and plot a decision curve, here is another function also implemented in the same packae:\nnb_plot \u0026lt;- function(form, data, treat_all = TRUE, treat_none = TRUE, omniscient = TRUE, weight = 1, max_neg = 0.1) { data \u0026lt;- as.data.table(data) # Identify vars .y \u0026lt;- all.vars(form)[1] .mods \u0026lt;- all.vars(form)[-1] dt_list \u0026lt;- lapply(.mods, function(m) { data.table(p_t = seq(0,0.99,.01))[, .(Model = m, net_benefit = nb(data[,get(m)], data[,get(.y)], p_t = p_t, weight = weight)), by = p_t] }) if (treat_all) { treat_all_dt \u0026lt;- data.table(p_t = seq(0,0.99,.01))[, .(Model = \u0026#39;Treat all\u0026#39;, net_benefit = nb(rep(1, nrow(data)), # guess 1 for everyone data[,get(.y)], p_t = p_t, weight = weight)), by = p_t] dt_list \u0026lt;- append(dt_list, list(treat_all_dt)) } if (treat_none) { treat_none_dt \u0026lt;- data.table(Model = \u0026#39;Treat none\u0026#39;, p_t = seq(0,0.99,.01), net_benefit = 0) dt_list \u0026lt;- append(dt_list, list(treat_none_dt)) } if (omniscient) { omniscient_dt \u0026lt;- data.table(p_t = seq(0,0.99,.01))[, .(Model = \u0026#39;Treat omnisciently\u0026#39;, net_benefit = nb(data[,get(.y)], data[,get(.y)], p_t = p_t, weight = weight)), by = p_t] dt_list \u0026lt;- append(dt_list, list(omniscient_dt)) } dt_all \u0026lt;- rbindlist(dt_list, use.names = TRUE) ymax \u0026lt;- max(dt_all$net_benefit, na.rm = TRUE) p \u0026lt;- ggplot(dt_all, aes(p_t, net_benefit, color = Model)) + geom_line(size = 0.3) + xlim(0, 1) + ylim(-1 * max_neg * ymax, ymax * 1.05) + xlab(\u0026#39;Threshold probability\u0026#39;) + ylab(\u0026#39;Net benefit\u0026#39;) + theme_bw() + coord_fixed() return(p) } This function accepts a formula form to indicate the outcome variable and then several models to compare simultaneously. Additional decision curves can be added to the plot for treat_all, treat_none, and omniscient treatment strategies. This calculation is really the benefit accrued to those treated and so the benefit of treating none is by definition zero (and so does not account for the potential costs of a false negative error, i.e. failing to treat someone who could have benefited from treatment).\n Example (A completely invented case study) Let’s say we have a bunch of penguins from the palmerpenguins dataset all hanging out together. Sadly, the water has been contaminated on the island of Biscoe and all of penguins from that island need an urgent antidote to prevent them from falling ill. However, the local ecologist doesn’t know which island the penguins came from and instead can only measure their bills, flippers, body mass, and sex. Let’s build some classification models to help the ecologist find penguins who need treatment.\n# Load libraries and data library(gmish) # remotes::install_github(\u0026#39;gweissman/gmish\u0026#39;) if not installed already library(data.table) library(ggplot2) library(palmerpenguins) library(ranger) library(ggsci) # Use complete cases for the example pp \u0026lt;- penguins[complete.cases(penguins),] # Take a look at the data ggplot(pp, aes(bill_length_mm, flipper_length_mm, size = body_mass_g, color = sex)) + geom_point() + facet_grid(~island) + theme_bw() + scale_color_aaas() # Build a model model1 \u0026lt;- glm(island == \u0026#39;Biscoe\u0026#39; ~ bill_length_mm + flipper_length_mm + body_mass_g + sex, family = binomial, data = pp) summary(model1) ## ## Call: ## glm(formula = island == \u0026quot;Biscoe\u0026quot; ~ bill_length_mm + flipper_length_mm + ## body_mass_g + sex, family = binomial, data = pp) ## ## Deviance Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -1.7141 -0.6526 -0.1626 0.3955 2.4611 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

So we have a general sense of the models’ performance, which seems pretty good overall. The fact that they are all likely very overfit in this example is important to mention but we’ll deal with that in a later conversation. Now, we’re stuck with the question, which model should we use to pick out the penguins for treatment? The regression model or the random forest model?\nThe intended use case for decision curves is to identify the optimal model given a choice of threshold. In this case, let’s say that the medication does have some but not terrible side effects, so we prefer a decision threshold around 30%. Which model provides the most benefit in this range?\n# For simplicity, just plot the net benefit of the two models trained above nb_plot(sick_island ~ glm + rf, data = results_dt, treat_all = FALSE, treat_none = FALSE, omniscient = FALSE) Clearly in the 30% threshold range, the random forest model provides more benefit to those treated. Now let’s compare these models against treat all, treat none, and treat omnisciently strategies.\nnb_plot(sick_island ~ glm + rf, data = results_dt, treat_all = TRUE, treat_none = TRUE, omniscient = TRUE) ## Warning: Removed 48 rows containing missing values (`geom_line()`). The treat none strategy, by definition, provides zero net benefit, so represents a lower bound of what the other models should provide if they are useful. The treat omnisciently strategy represents the upper bound on what any model could provide. In this case, the treat all strategy does a little better than the glm model in the 10 to 20% threshold range, but otherwise provides less net benefit than both the glm and rf across the rest of the range.\nLet’s again highlight the range of interest that we determined ahead of time based on our choice of threshold which here determines the relative weighting of true and false positives. However, if you asked the penguins, they might choose a different threshold!\nSince we chose 30% as our decision threshold, let’s examine the neighborhood around 30% looking at 5% in either direction.\nnb_plot(sick_island ~ glm + rf, data = results_dt, treat_all = TRUE, treat_none = TRUE, omniscient = TRUE) \u0026amp; geom_rect(xmin = 0.25, xmax = 0.35, ymin = 0, ymax = 0.5, color = \u0026#39;gray\u0026#39;, fill = \u0026#39;gray\u0026#39;, alpha = 0.01, inherit.aes = FALSE) ## Warning: Removed 48 rows containing missing values (`geom_line()`). In this range of interest, the random forest model provides the highest net benefit. Let’s go save some penguins!\n ","date":1669766400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1669826555,"objectID":"dabc2833bc7d5073e81df4845b550a54","permalink":"https://gweissman.github.io/post/net-benefit-and-decision-curve-analysis-in-r-some-helpful-functions/","publishdate":"2022-11-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/net-benefit-and-decision-curve-analysis-in-r-some-helpful-functions/","section":"post","summary":"Background One of the challenges of developing clinical prediction models is deciding which one is best.

The UMLS is a suite of data and software resources that offers several tools for processing, representing, and analyzing biomedical text data. One exciting use case that we\u0026rsquo;ll explore here is using UMLS to identify signs and symptoms that are documented in the text of clinical encounter notes.\nMetaMap is a software tool that identifies concepts in the text of clinical notes that are found in UMLS ontologies. MetaMap is written in Java and there is a convenient wrapper in Python: PyMetaMap written by Anthony Rios. There are other Python wrappers around MetaMap but PyMetaMap was the most straightforward to get running on my machine so that\u0026rsquo;s what we\u0026rsquo;ll use here.\nStep 1: Installation Make sure you have have MetaMap installed. Instructions are here: https://metamap.nlm.nih.gov/Installation.shtml\nI used the default settings for the installation and it has worked out fine.\nNB To use most UMLS resources you will have to register for an account and sign a data use agreement. This is free!\nStep 2: Get some text data Because working with clinical notes is often challening due to issues of de-identification, here are a few sample text notes we\u0026rsquo;ll use here.

In best- and worst-case scenarios of surges in the number of patients with COVID-19, the needed total capac- ity for hospital beds would reach 3131 to 12 650 across the 3 hospitals, including 338 to 1608 ICU beds and 118 to 599 ventilators. **Limitations:** Model parameters were taken directly or derived from published data across heterogeneous populations and practice environments and from the health system's historical data. CHIME does not incorporate more transition states to model infection severity, social networks to model transmission dynamics, or geographic information to account for spatial pat- terns of human interaction. **Conclusion:** Publicly available and designed for hospital oper- ations leaders, this modeling tool can inform preparations for capacity strain during the early days of a pandemic.","tags":null,"title":"Locally Informed Simulation to Predict Hospital Capacity Needs During the COVID-19 Pandemic","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":["blog","r","bootstrapping","predictive modeling"],"content":"  Background Bootstrapping is a helpful technique for identifying the variance of an estimate in a given sample when no other data are available. In the case of the evaluation of clinical prediction models, bootstrapping can be used to estimate confidence intervals around performance metrics such as the Brier score, the c-statistic, and others. When the original model and its tuning parameters, and the original dataset are available, the data can be resampled and the model refit on each replicate to make predictions. These predictions can then be used to calculate a performance metric. However, sometimes only the predicted probabilities of the original model on the original dataset are available. In this case, the predicted probabilities can be resampled and the performance metric can be calculated on each of these replicates. How do these approaches compare?\n Build a model Similar to the model built in another blog post about the Brier Score, let’s build a model with the abalone dataset.\n# set seed set.seed(24601) # load libraries for plotting library(ggplot2) # get data df \u0026lt;- read.csv(\u0026#39;https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/abalone/abalone.data\u0026#39;) names(df) \u0026lt;- c(\u0026#39;sex\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;length\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;diameter\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;height\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;weight_whole\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;weight_shucked\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;weight_viscera\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;weight_shell\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;rings\u0026#39;) # inspect data knitr::kable(head(df))     sex length diameter height weight_whole weight_shucked weight_viscera weight_shell rings    M 0.350 0.265 0.090 0.2255 0.0995 0.0485 0.070 7  F 0.530 0.420 0.135 0.6770 0.2565 0.1415 0.210 9  M 0.440 0.365 0.125 0.5160 0.2155 0.1140 0.155 10  I 0.330 0.255 0.080 0.2050 0.0895 0.0395 0.055 7  I 0.425 0.300 0.095 0.3515 0.1410 0.0775 0.120 8  F 0.530 0.415 0.150 0.7775 0.2370 0.1415 0.330 20    # Let\u0026#39;s predict whether or not an abalone will have \u0026gt; 10 rings m \u0026lt;- glm(I(rings \u0026gt; 10) ~ ., data = df, family = binomial) preds_m \u0026lt;- predict(m, type = \u0026#39;response\u0026#39;)  Performance metric Let’s calculate the Brier score as a measure of model performance.\nbrier_score \u0026lt;- function(preds, obs) { mean((obs - preds)^2) }  Boostrapping the predicted probabilities only Now let’s estimate the 95% confidence interval of the Brier score using only the predicted probabilities.\nN \u0026lt;- 1000 get_boot_est_preds \u0026lt;- function(preds, obs, metric) { idx \u0026lt;- sample(length(preds), replace = TRUE) metric(preds[idx], obs[idx]) } reps_pred \u0026lt;- replicate(N, get_boot_est_preds(preds_m, df$rings \u0026gt; 10, brier_score))  Bootstrapping to refit the model on each replicate get_boot_est_mod \u0026lt;- function(df, metric) { idx \u0026lt;- sample(nrow(df), replace = TRUE) m_b \u0026lt;- glm(I(rings \u0026gt; 10) ~ ., data = df[idx,], family = binomial) preds_m_b \u0026lt;- predict(m_b, type = \u0026#39;response\u0026#39;) metric(preds_m_b, df[idx,]$rings \u0026gt; 10) } reps_model \u0026lt;- replicate(N, get_boot_est_mod(df, brier_score))  Optimism corrected bootstrapping to refit the model on each replicate As pointed out by Ewout Steyerberg, these estimates should be optimism-corrected for potential overfitting.

However, this outcome may vary depending on potential bias in the original dataset, and the sensitivity of the model to such bias. The third approach demonstrates the likely high degree of overfitting in this model, and the need to properly correct for optimism when reporting predictive performance in the absence of a separate testing sample.\n ","date":1556150400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1556150400,"objectID":"9b3e536ea78160bfe348fe66eeff3bc3","permalink":"https://gweissman.github.io/post/comparison-of-bootstrapping-approaches-for-identifying-variance-of-predictive-performance/","publishdate":"2019-04-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/comparison-of-bootstrapping-approaches-for-identifying-variance-of-predictive-performance/","section":"post","summary":"Background Bootstrapping is a helpful technique for identifying the variance of an estimate in a given sample when no other data are available.

The Brier Score is defined as\n\\[ BS = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum (y_i - \\hat y_i)^2, \\]\nwhere \\(N\\) is the number of observations, \\(y_i\\) is the observed outcome, either 0 or 1, and \\(\\hat y_i\\) is the predicted probability for the \\(i\\)th observation. Let’s create an R function to calculate the Brier Score:\nbrier_score \u0026lt;- function(obs, pred) { mean((obs - pred)^2) } The scaled Brier Score accounts for the event rate and provides an immediate comparison to an uninformative model that is equivalent to “just guess the event rate.” An intuitive way to define the scaled Brier Score (also called the “Brier skill score”) is\n\\[ BS_{scaled} = 1 - \\frac{BS}{BS_{max}}, \\]\nwhere \\(BS_{max} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum (y_i - \\bar y_i)^2\\) and \\(\\bar y_i\\) is the event rate among the observed outcome.\n My confusion This formulation of the scaled Brier Score makes intuitive sense to me and is how I go about calculating it in practice. However, two other distinct formulations have been proposed for calculating \\(BS_{max}\\) that — at least to the limits of my algebraic skills – differ.

The relevant hyperlinks and igraph code have been updated to reflect the current state of things. The edgelist, despite many more intervening seasons, and thus many more romances, has not been updated. Here is a nice walkthrough of ERGMs based on this post \u0026ndash; sorry for the broken link, Ben.\nThis all began with an introductory presentation about social network analysis to a group of medical students. What better way to grab their attention than with attractive, fake doctors having sex on television? Naturally this led to the dense network of sexual contacts between characters on the Grey’s Anatomy television show. After viewing many hours of previous episodes and exploring fan pages (especially here for an early attempt at a graph representation of sexual contacts), I was able to come up with an extensive but by no means exhaustive list of contacts. The edge list is available here.\nThis example uses the igraph package for R, both free to download. First we create the graph, give it a layout, and plot.\nlibrary(igraph) ga.data \u0026lt;- read.csv('ga_edgelist.csv', header = TRUE) g \u0026lt;- graph.data.frame(ga.data, directed=FALSE) summary(g) g$layout \u0026lt;- layout.fruchterman.reingold(g) plot(g)     Without knowing who is represented by each vertex, what can you deduce from the graph? From a public health perspective, if you could test one person for sexually transmitted infections (STIs), who would it be? If you could provide counseling and a free box of condoms to one person, who would it be? If you knew that an epidemic was spreading through this network, who would you want to be to best avoid it?\nNow let’s make the visualization a little more interesting. First we can remove the labels for now, and then change the size of the vertex to represent the degree, or degree centrality, corresponding to the number of partners of each vertex. In the context of transmissible infections, this would indicate the number of people a person could infect or be infected by through sexual contact.\nV(g)$label \u0026lt;- NA # remove labels for now V(g)$size \u0026lt;- degree(g) * 2 # multiply by 2 for scale plot(g)     This tells us about the absolute number of partners, but not much about the relative position within the network. Let’s examine two types of centrality: closeness and betweenness. The closeness centrality is the average shortest path from one vertex to every other on the graph. A high number indicates that a vertex is quickly reachable by the majority of vertices in the graph, while a low number indicates that the vertex is far from most other vertices on the graph. We can calculate the centrality and then rescale the values to create a color scheme to visualize the relative differences.\nclo \u0026lt;- closeness(g) # rescale values to match the elements of a color vector clo.score \u0026lt;- round( (clo - min(clo)) * length(clo) / max(clo) ) + 1 # create color vector, use rev to make red \u0026quot;hot\u0026quot; clo.colors \u0026lt;- rev(heat.colors(max(clo.score))) V(g)$color \u0026lt;- clo.colors[ clo.score ] plot(g)     It appears there are a few vertices on the red “hot” end of the spectrum, and a few at the “cold” end. Next we do the same for each vertex to calculate the betweenness centrality, which is the number of shortest paths on the network that pass through the vertex. Vertices with high betweenness centrality might be thought of as serving a gatekeeper role in mediating the shortest connections between other vertices.\nbtw \u0026lt;- betweenness(g) btw.score \u0026lt;- round(btw) + 1 btw.colors \u0026lt;- rev(heat.colors(max(btw.score))) V(g)$color \u0026lt;- btw.colors[ btw.score ] plot(g)     This last graph of betweenness indicates slightly more variation among the likely suspects, while the analysis of closeness centrality demonstrated less variation. Why?\nA useful technique in social network analysis is the use of community finding algorithms. Here we use the implementation of the Girvan-Newman algorithm (paper here) to detect the underlying community structure of the graph. We will iterate through each merge to determine which cut produces the maximum modularity, and then use that number to calculate the groups.\n# this section has been substantially revised to reflect the # newer version of igraph which does GN membership easily V(g)$color \u0026lt;- membership(cluster_edge_betweenness(g)) V(g)$size \u0026lt;- 15 # reset to default size plot(g) # those new default igraph colors are so much nicer, too!     Once you see the graph with names, it is interesting to note the breaks in connectivity around race and age (I guess you have to know the TV characters to appreciate this ;) ) So before seeing the names, back to the original question. Who would you test? Who would you counsel? Who would you vaccinate? Who would you rather be?\nAnd the winners are…\nV(g)$color \u0026lt;- 'grey' V(g)$label \u0026lt;- V(g)$name V(g)$label.cex \u0026lt;- 0.7 # rescale the text size of the label plot(g)     ","date":1497484800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1497484800,"objectID":"37fc9011f34f7a12f94f2f3bbeac8aeb","permalink":"https://gweissman.github.io/post/grey-s-anatomy-network-of-sexual-relations/","publishdate":"2017-06-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/grey-s-anatomy-network-of-sexual-relations/","section":"post","summary":"Here\u0026rsquo;s the blog post originally posted on babelgraph.org on March 25, 2011.

I suspect the twitter API and much of the code below are not up to date.\nI am a recent comer to twitter, and it took me a few weeks to figure out what this was all about. Who are all these people tweeting each other and what do all these trending hashtags mean? Do these people all know each other? How do they get involved in these conversations? Are people really talking/listening to each other, or just spewing 140 character projectiles out into the void?\nThis piqued my interest in the structure of relationships of participants in different twitter conversations. Using R, with the twitteR and igraph packages, I wondered what I would find\u0026hellip;\nIn terms of mapping twitter networks with R, I found this post for mapping one’s own personal network of connections. For other visualizations, I found a collection of various visualizations for the twitterverse, and an interactive map of connected users.\nHere I am really interested in the network of participants in a particular conversation. I started off with “#Rstats,” expecting to see a tightly knit community of users who all seem to know each other (at least virtually), sending each other personal updates or tech support tweets. Next I looked at “#Libya,” where I imagined there would be a lot of twitterers with massive followings, but who were unlikely following each other, and producing hordes of news-type updates. Finally I looked at “#Bieber,” (I swear didn’t even know who he was up until a few weeks ago), where I expected to see platoons of small-time twitterers, who likely don’t follow each other, pouring out disconnected digital adulations into the twitterverse.\nThe following script was used to construct the networks for each search item.\n# an R script to generate the social network of contributors # to a particular search term # author: Gary Weissman # twitter: @garyweissman # choose a conversation and size of search search.term \u0026lt;- '#Rstats' search.size \u0026lt;- 50 # load required libraries library(igraph) library(twitteR) # get recent results from search search.results \u0026lt;- searchTwitter(search.term,n=search.size) # build the vertex list vl \u0026lt;- vector() for (twt in search.results) vl \u0026lt;- c(vl,screenName(twt)) # calculate contribution of each user in the conversation vl \u0026lt;- as.data.frame(table(vl)) # provide nice names for data colnames(vl) \u0026lt;- c('user','tweets') # build the network of relations between contributors g \u0026lt;- graph.empty(directed=TRUE) g \u0026lt;- add.vertices(g,nrow(vl),name=as.character(vl$user), tweets=vl$tweets) V(g)$followers \u0026lt;- 0 # default to zero # count total number of followers in the larger twitterverse and # add relationships based on who follows whom within the conversation for (usr in V(g)) { # get the user info by name tuser \u0026lt;- getUser(V(g)$name[usr+1]) print(paste(\u0026quot;Getting info on\u0026quot;,screenName(tuser))) # count total followers in larger twitterverse V(g)$followers[usr+1] \u0026lt;- followersCount(tuser) # access as many followers as we can to see if any # appeared in the search results followers.list \u0026lt;- userFollowers(tuser,n=1200) for (tflwr in followers.list) { if (screenName(tflwr) %in% V(g)$name) g \u0026lt;- add.edges(g,c(as.vector(V(g)[ name == screenName(tflwr) ]),usr)) } print('Sleeping 10 min...') Sys.sleep(600); # don't exceed request limit } # layout the graph g$layout \u0026lt;- layout.fruchterman.reingold(g) # adjust size based on number of total followers # scale accordingly to keep readable V(g)$size = log( V(g)$followers ) * 1.8 # set label name and size V(g)$label=V(g)$name V(g)$label.cex = 0.6 # do something with color... tcolors \u0026lt;- rev(heat.colors(max(V(g)$tweets))) V(g)$color \u0026lt;- tcolors[ V(g)$tweets ] # make edge arrows less intrusive E(g)$arrow.size \u0026lt;- 0.3 # make symmetric connections a little easier to read E(g)$curved \u0026lt;- FALSE # fun to play with E(g)$color \u0026lt;- 'blue' # now plot... plot(g)  Technical notes: It wasn’t always clear to me what counted as a “request” in the twitter API, because even a small handful of requests with long results would sometimes seem to count as more toward the hourly quota. Putting a ten minute delay between requests with Sys.sleep(600) was enough to solve the problem. I also tweaked the layouts a bit using tkplot.getcoords(). NB. tkplot() does not permit certain graph attributes such as label.vertex.cex, so you have to remove it before opening the graph in tkplot. You can then just add it back later. More details on this tkplot issue here.\nThe size of the vertex is proportional to the log of the number of followers in the wider twitterverse, and the color of vertex represents the number of tweets found in the search results by that user. See code above for specifics.\n#Bieber\n   #Libya\n   #Rstats\n   The networks obviously look very different. Here is a plot of the degree distribution of each graph:\n   Even more interesting is the simple comparison of the number of edges in each graph. Very telling.\n   I did not look at the clustering coefficient here, but that would be interesting, too.\nDoes this mean that R users are part of a twitter community?\nLimitations on this approach include the size of the user sample (limited by the twitter API to 150 requests per hour), as well as limits on the size of lists retrieved by the userFriends() method (I believe the limit is 1200 items). These former limits the sample size significantly, and provides only a brief snapshot in time of the participants in any one conversation. The latter favors the construction of edges between twitterers with fewer followers, thus understestimating the total edges that may exist in the network. Is there a workaround for these limitations on the API? I believe requesting whitelist status from twitter, or perhaps authenticating with ROAuth would increase the number of permitted requests, but I haven’t tried them yet.\nDo you know to whom you tweet?\n","date":1497484800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1497484800,"objectID":"e73486bd40f80a4c177c37a1ecf87fb8","permalink":"https://gweissman.github.io/post/the-structure-of-twitter-participant-relationships-in-conversations-around-libya-bieber-and-rstats/","publishdate":"2017-06-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/the-structure-of-twitter-participant-relationships-in-conversations-around-libya-bieber-and-rstats/","section":"post","summary":"Here\u0026rsquo;s the blog post originally posted on babelgraph.org on April 4, 2011.

It required a small tweak with NumericVector::create \u0026ndash; see below.\nIn particular, R data frames provide a simple framework for representing large cohorts of agents in stochastic epidemiological models, such as those representing disease transmission. This approach is much easier and likely faster than trying to implement cohorts of R objects. In this post we’ll explore a simple agent-based model, and then benchmark a few different approaches to iterating through the cohort. Rcpp outperforms all of them by a few orders of magnitude. Priceless.\nCase Let’s say we are trying to predict the probability of someone choosing to receive a vaccination in a given year. The decision will be based on their age (age), gender (female), and whether or not they were infected with the virus last year (ily). Let’s make up some data:\n# construct a cohort N \u0026lt;- 1000 # cohort size cohort \u0026lt;- data.frame(age=rnorm(N,mean=50,sd=10), female=sample(c(0,1),size=N,replace=TRUE), ily=sample(c(0,1),size=N,prob=c(0.8,0.2), replace=TRUE))  The probability of choosing to be vaccinated will be given by the following function:\nvaccinate \u0026lt;- function( age, female, ily) { # this is based on some pretend regression equation p \u0026lt;- 0.25 + 0.3 * 1/(1-exp(0.04 * age)) + 0.1 *ily # use some logic p \u0026lt;- p * ifelse(female, 1.25 , 0.75) # boundary checking p \u0026lt;- max(0,p); p \u0026lt;- min(1,p) p }  Try some iterators: for loop, apply, ddply Let’s create a testable function for each strategy. The objective is to take a cohort data frame as input, calculate the vaccination probability for each member of the cohort, then return a data frame with the cohort data plus a new column for the vaccination probability (p).\n# The traditional for loop # Some would say is always a no-no in R... do_forloop \u0026lt;- function(df) { v_prob \u0026lt;- vector(length=nrow(df),mode=\u0026quot;numeric\u0026quot;) for (x in 1:nrow(df)) { v_prob[x] \u0026lt;- vaccinate(df$age[x], df$female[x],df$ily[x]) } data.frame(cbind(df,p=v_prob)) } # The apply approach do_apply \u0026lt;- function(df) { v_prob \u0026lt;- apply(df, 1, function(x) vaccinate(x[1],x[2],x[3])) data.frame(cbind(df,p=v_prob)) } # ddply approach library(plyr) do_plyr \u0026lt;- function (df) { v_prob \u0026lt;- ddply (df, names(df), function(x) vaccinate(x$age,x$female,x$ily)) data.frame(cbind(df,p=v_prob$V1)) }  Enter Rcpp Now rewrite the test using a traditional for-loop in C++ including a helper function to calculate the vaccination probability. I use the inline library so I can embed the C++ directly in the R script, thus obviating additional .cpp or .h files.

These scores exhibit only moderate performance and are often evaluated using aggregated measures over time. A simulated prospective validation strategy that assesses multiple predictions per patient-day would provide the best pragmatic evaluation. We developed a deep recurrent neural network deterioration model and conducted a simulated prospective evaluation. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Four hospitals in Pennsylvania. PATIENTS: Inpatient adults discharged between July 1, 2017, and June 30, 2019. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We trained a deep recurrent neural network and logistic regression model using data from electronic health records to predict hourly the 24-hour composite outcome of transfer to ICU or death. We analyzed 146,446 hospitalizations with 16.75 million patient-hours. The hourly event rate was 1.6% (12,842 transfers or deaths, corresponding to 260,295 patient-hours within the predictive horizon). On a hold-out dataset, the deep recurrent neural network achieved an area under the precision-recall curve of 0.042 (95% CI, 0.04–0.043), comparable with logistic regression model (0.043; 95% CI 0.041 to 0.045), and outperformed National Early Warning Score (0.034; 95% CI, 0.032–0.035), Modified Early Warning Score (0.028; 95% CI, 0.027– 0.03), and quick Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment (0.021; 95% CI, 0.021–0.022). For a fixed sensitivity of 50%, the deep recurrent neural network achieved a positive predictive value of 3.4% (95% CI, 3.4–3.5) and outperformed logistic regression model (3.1%; 95% CI 3.1–3.2), National Early Warning Score (2.0%; 95% CI, 2.0–2.0), Modified Early Warning Score (1.5%; 95% CI, 1.5–1.5), and quick Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment (1.5%; 95% CI, 1.5–1.5). CONCLUSIONS: Commonly used early warning scores for clinical decompensation, along with a logistic regression model and a deep recurrent neural network model, show very poor performance characteristics when assessed using a simulated prospective validation. None of these models may be suitable for real-time deployment.","tags":null,"title":"A Simulated Prospective Evaluation of a Deep Learning Model for Real-Time Prediction of Clinical Deterioration Among Ward Patients","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zachary Flamholz","Andrew Crane-Droesch","Lyle Ungar","Gary Weissman"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"1cd414d10141617b1400a1bbc4b13f7c","permalink":"https://gweissman.github.io/publication/embeddings_jbi_2021/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/embeddings_jbi_2021/","section":"publication","summary":"Objective: Quantify tradeoffs in performance, reproducibility, and resource demands across several strategies for developing clinically relevant word embeddings.\nMaterials and methods: We trained separate embeddings on all full-text manuscripts in the Pubmed Central (PMC) Open Access subset, case reports therein, the English Wikipedia corpus, the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) III dataset, and all notes in the University of Pennsylvania Health System (UPHS) electronic health record. We tested embeddings in six clinically relevant tasks including mortality prediction and de-identification, and assessed performance using the scaled Brier score (SBS) and the proportion of notes successfully de-identified, respectively.\nResults: Embeddings from UPHS notes best predicted mortality (SBS 0.30, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.45) while Wikipedia embeddings performed worst (SBS 0.12, 95% CI −0.05 to 0.28). Wikipedia embeddings most consistently (78% of notes) and the full PMC corpus embeddings least consistently (48%) de-identified notes. Across all six tasks, the full PMC corpus demonstrated the most consistent performance, and the Wikipedia corpus the least. Corpus size ranged from 49 million tokens (PMC case reports) to 10 billion (UPHS).\nDiscussion: Embeddings trained on published case reports performed as least as well as embeddings trained on other corpora in most tasks, and clinical corpora consistently outperformed non-clinical corpora. No single corpus produced a strictly dominant set of embeddings across all tasks and so the optimal training corpus depends on intended use.\nConclusion: Embeddings trained on published case reports performed comparably on most clinical tasks to embeddings trained on larger corpora.
